Description: This package provides a function for reconstructing a bacterial
  pangenome from a set of microbial genomes in gff3 format, and using a local 
  copy of Pfam-A database. It attempts to group proteins with equal domain
  architecture, and then applies a tree prunning algorithm to split true
  orthologue sequences from paraogues.
